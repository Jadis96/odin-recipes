    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>You can use virtually any fish for sashimi, but two of the most popular are salmon and the fattier cuts of tuna. The fish must be extremely fresh. A specialist Japanese fishmonger might offer sashimi-ready fillets so all you need to do is slice them. Otherwise, ask your fishmonger for long fillets at least 3cm thick, then trim them into blocks 5cm wide and 2cm thick.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>about 150g per person  sashimi-grade tuna or salmon</li>
        <li>wasabi</li>
        <li>Japanese soy sauce</li>

        <li>1 mooli (white radish), spiralised or shredded </li>
        <li>for decoration shiso leaves or micro leaves</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p> Just before you are ready to eat, slice the fillet, against the grain into little rectangles about 2cm thick.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p> The technique is to hold the fish firmly with one hand, position the knife beside your fingers to make an against-the-grain slice and pull the knife through from base to tip in a single stroke.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Serve with the accompaniments, using the leaves to decorate.</p>
