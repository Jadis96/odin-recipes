    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> In Japan, Tempura (天ぷら) is serious stuff. Japanese chefs would spend years mastering the technique of tempura frying. And home cooks will themselves in front of the hot oil in their tiny kitchens. All for the food we so love.

        To make tempura worthy of your effort, freshness matters. So do the batter and deep-frying technique. Sure, making perfect tempura requires skills and practice, but I am here to tell you that it is possible to make the perfectly-airy, crispy, and non-greasy tempura right from your home.
        
        Let’s learn all the secrets today!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour (plain flour)</li>
        <li>1 cold large egg (50 g without shell)</li>
        <li>200 ml iced water</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p> Most tempura restaurants use untoasted sesame oil or their own special blend of oil. At home, you can also use a neutral-flavored oil such as vegetable or rice bran oil or canola oil, and simply add a touch of sesame oil for a deliciously nutty aroma. Use clean, new oil instead of used oil.

            Ideally, the oil should fill up to ½ of the pot. The minimum oil you need in a frying pan is 1 inch deep. The more oil you have, the more ability the oil will have to sustain its ideal temperature throughout frying.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p> Ideal oil temperature for frying –  Depending on the ingredients, we are looking at the range of 320-350°F (160-180°C). Use a thermometer for precise temperature control, especially if you’re not familiar with deep frying.

            You can check the approximate temperature by dropping the batter into the oil.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Do not overcrowd the frying pot with ingredients – As a rule of thumb, only half of the oil surface should be covered with ingredients. So, deep fry in batches.
            Keep the oil temperature steady at all times.
            Turn the tempura regularly to ensure even cooking.
            Pick up crumbs in the oil between batches – You wouldn’t want any burnt crumbs to attach to your new tempura pieces or dilute the oil flavor.</p>
